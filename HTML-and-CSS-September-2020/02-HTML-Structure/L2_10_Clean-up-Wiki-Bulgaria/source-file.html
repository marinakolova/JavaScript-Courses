		One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karanovo_culture">Karanovo culture</a>, which
		dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians">Thracians</a>,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians">Persians</a>,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts" title="Celts">Celts</a> and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonians">ancient Macedonians</a>; stability came when the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD 45.
		The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars">Bulgar</a> horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded
		the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which
		dominated most of the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans">Balkans</a> and significantly influenced
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs">Slavic</a> cultures by developing the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic script</a>.
		This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II">Basil II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful
		Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bulgarian_Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its
		apex under
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Asen_II">Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting
		wars and
		feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries.

	<p>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%9378)">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a>
		resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left
		outside its borders, which led to
		several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria">one-party socialist state</a> and part
		of the Soviet-led
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. The ruling
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Communist_Party">Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on
		power after the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989">revolutions of 1989</a> and allowed
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party">multi-party</a> elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign state</a> has been a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state">unitary</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic">parliamentary republic</a> with a high degree of

		and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s.

	<h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p>
		The name <i>Bulgaria</i> is derived from the
		<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars">Bulgars</a></i>, a tribe of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples">Turkic</a> origin that founded the country. Their name is
		not completely understood
		and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGolden1992103%E2%80%93104-10">[7]</a>
		but it is possibly derived from the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Turkic">Proto-Turkic</a> word <i>bulģha</i> ("to mix", "shake",
		"stir") and its derivative
		<i>bulgak</i> ("revolt", "disorder").
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#cite_note-11">[8]</a> The meaning may be further
		extended to "rebel", "incite" or "produce a state of disorder", i.e. the "disturbers".
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChen201297-12">[9]</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#cite_note-13">[10]</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGolden1992104-14">[11]</a> Ethnic groups in
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Asia">Inner Asia</a> with phonologically similar names were
		frequently described in similar terms:
		during the 4th century, the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jie_people">Buluoji</a>, a component of the "
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Barbarians">Five Barbarian</a>" groups in Ancient China,
		were portrayed as both a "mixed race" and "troublemakers".
